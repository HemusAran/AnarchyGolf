If you prepare testcases file, caddy can be used for other golf
challenges (e.g. http://codegolf.com/). Suppose you have the solution
of "99 bottles of beer" (http://codegolf.com/99-bottles-of-beer) as
"bottle.rb". In this case, caddy checks if there is a file
"bottle.test" in the current directory. If it exists, caddy extracts
testcases from the file. Please check sample/* for the format of the
testcase file.

There is another format of testcases. If there are files named
test/bottle*.output and test/bottle*.input (*.input is optional),
caddy extracts testcases from these files. The sample if in cg/*.
And, if you use the same naming convention as mine, you can use cg/*
to test your solutions for codegolf.com. Note that the files under cg/
are incomplete.
