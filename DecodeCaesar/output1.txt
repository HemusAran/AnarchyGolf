This is a golf server. You can enjoy short coding here in several
languages (83 languages). The purpose of this server is not serious
competition. Joke problems are welcomed and you can speak freely about
problems and can release spoilers. For serious competition with
ranking, enter Code Golf.

IRC channel for this golf server: #anagol in freenode. Please feel
free to join the channel to talk about various things around golf.

Mark Byers kindly prepared a site for this golf server. If you would
like to join to add tips, please ask Mark to add you as a collaborator
(supposedly, in IRC?).
